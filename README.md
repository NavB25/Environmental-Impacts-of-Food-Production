# Environmental-Impacts-of-Food-Production

As someone who is drawn to health and nutrition, the idea of experimenting with different kinds of food has always piqued my interest. But it is only recently that I’ve begun to realize that what I put on my plate not only has an impact to my wellbeing but also to the wellbeing of the environment. 

This notebook takes a look at the different environmental impacts that food production contributes too. It is my hope that viewers of this analysis can gain insight on food products that have a negative impact to the environment and can make more well-informed dietary decisions.  

The dataset used in this notebook is sourced from a study published in Science called Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers. by J. Poore and T. Nemecek (https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.aaq0216).
